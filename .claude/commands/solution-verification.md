From now on, do not simply affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct. Your goal is to be an intellectual sparring partner, not just an agreeable assistant.

Every time I present an idea, do the following:
1. Analyze my assumptions. What am I taking for granted that might not be true?
2. Provide counterpoints.
What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?
3. Test my reasoning. Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws or gaps I haven't considered?
4. Offer alternative perspectives. How else might this idea be framed, interpreted, or challenged?
5. Prioritize truth over agreement. If I am wrong or my logic is weak, I need to know. Correct me clearly and explain why.

Maintain a constructive, but rigorous, approach. Your role is not to argue for the sake of arguing, but to push me toward greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty. If I ever start slipping into confirmation bias or unchecked assumptions, call it out directly. Let's refine not just our conclusions, but how we arrive at them.

## Git & PR Workflow (SWE Best Practices — Appendable Section)

> **Purpose:** Give Claude Code (and humans) a deterministic, repeatable Git workflow for every feature/bugfix.
> **Rules:** No direct commits to `main`. Every change lives on a short-lived branch, gated by CI, code review, and clear rollback.

---

### 1) Branching Strategy (MECE)

* **Branch types (Conventional Commits scopes):**

  * `feat/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – new user-visible functionality
  * `fix/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – bug fixes
  * `refactor/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – non-behavioral code changes
  * `perf/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – performance improvements
  * `docs/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – documentation only
  * `chore/<scope>-<slug>-#<issue>` – tooling, deps, CI, no product code
* **Examples:**
  `feat/alerts-subscriber-activation-#123`
  `fix/etl-usnews-parser-zip-normalization-#412`

---

### 2) Local Setup & Sync

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
# create a new branch
BRANCH="feat/alerts-subscriber-activation-#123"
git checkout -b "$BRANCH"
```

> **Principle:** Always start from a fresh `main` and **fast-forward only**.

---

### 3) Commit Discipline (Conventional Commits)

* **Format:** `type(scope): summary`
  Types: `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore|build|ci`
* **Good examples:**

  * `feat(alerts): enable subscriber activation + async watcher start (closes #123)`
  * `fix(ingest): guard against missing rank range in USNews (#412)`
* **Guidelines:**

  * Small, atomic commits; each passes tests locally.
  * Include rationale in body, reference issue IDs, and **migration/rollback notes if relevant**.
  * Never commit secrets; `.env*` and credentials remain ignored.

---

### 4) Pre-Commit Quality Gates (run locally)

```bash
# typical composite target; adapt to repo
make check \
 && make test \
 && make typecheck \
 && make lint \
 && make migrate:dryrun
```

> **Minimum bar:** Tests green, types clean, lints pass, migrations reviewed with rollback steps documented.

---

### 5) Rebase Hygiene (keep branch current)

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# resolve conflicts, run tests again
make check && make test
# if needed:
git rebase --continue
```

> **Policy:** Prefer **rebase over merge** on feature branches to keep history linear and reviewable.

---

### 6) Push & Open PR

```bash
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
```

**PR title:** mirror your best commit subject.
**PR description (template):**

* **What & Why:** one paragraph linking the SPEC/issue
* **Scope:** files, modules, user-visible changes
* **Risk/Migrations:** forward/backward steps, rollout plan
* **Testing Evidence:** unit/integration results, screenshots as needed
* **Performance/SLI impact:** expected P95, cache changes
* **Security/Compliance:** data handling, FH/PII considerations

**Required gates before merge:**

* CI: lint, typecheck, tests, migrations, schema checks
* Coverage: ≥ agreed threshold (e.g., 80%+ on changed lines)
* **2 approvals** (code owners where relevant)

---

### 7) Review Etiquette

* **Authors:** respond to each comment; prefer follow-up commits over force-push unless rebasing; keep PR small.
* **Reviewers:** focus on correctness, security, data contracts, and performance; propose concrete changes.
* **Claude Code:** may propose diffs but **human approval is mandatory**.

---

### 8) Merge Strategy & Post-Merge

* **Default:** **Squash & Merge** to keep `main` clean and enable single-commit rollback.
* **When to “Rebase & Merge”:** shared feature branches with granular commit history required.
* **After merge:**

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull --ff-only origin main
  git branch -d "$BRANCH"
  git push origin --delete "$BRANCH"
  ```
* **Tag & Release (if user-visible or deployable):**

  * Semantic Versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  * Auto-generate CHANGELOG from Conventional Commits (e.g., `git-cliff`/`standard-version`)
  * Annotated tag:

    ```bash
    VERSION="v1.12.0"
    git tag -a "$VERSION" -m "Release $VERSION: alerts subscriber activation"
    git push origin "$VERSION"
    ```

---

### 9) Hotfix Protocol (production breakage)

```bash
git checkout -b fix/hotfix-<slug>-#<issue> origin/main
# minimal, surgical change + tests
make check && make test
git push -u origin fix/hotfix-<slug>-#<issue>
# fast-track PR: 1 owner + 1 engineer approval, CI green
# post-merge: tag PATCH release (e.g., v1.12.1), announce in release notes
```

---

### 10) Migrations & Rollbacks (zero-downtime)

* **Forward:** add columns/tables with defaults → dual-write if needed → deploy code reading new shape.
* **Backward:** keep old paths for one deploy cycle → remove only after verification.
* **Document** both in PR body. Include `migrate:up` / `migrate:down` commands.

---

### 11) Large Files, Secrets, & Binary Artifacts

* **Git LFS** for files >10 MB (maps/images if necessary).
* **Never** commit secrets. Use `.env.local` + secret manager (SOPS, AWS SM).
* Generated assets (PDFs, Parquet) live in object storage, **not** in Git.

---

### 12) Useful Recovery Commands

```bash
# undo last commit but keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# discard local changes to a file
git restore --source=HEAD -- path/to/file

# find lost commits
git reflog

# revert a bad commit on main
git revert <sha>

# abort a rebase/merge
git rebase --abort
git merge --abort
```

---

### 13) Hooks & Automation

* **Pre-commit:** formatters, linters, secret scanners (`pre-commit`, Husky).
* **Pre-push:** run fast test subset or schema checks.
* **CI:** repeat local gates; block merges on failures; publish artifacts (coverage, docs).

---

### 14) Claude Command — “Git Feature Flow” (for inclusion in command .md)

```
/git-feature-flow "<issue_title>" "<issue_id>" "<scope>" "<slug>"
1) Create branch: {type from issue labels}:{scope}-{slug}-#{issue_id}
2) Read SPEC/PRD for this issue ONLY; do not modify unrelated files.
3) Implement in small commits (Conventional Commits). Each commit must pass: lint, typecheck, unit tests.
4) Rebase on origin/main before pushing.
5) Open PR with the standard template; attach test evidence and migration/rollback steps.
6) Wait for CI + 2 approvals; address feedback via commits (no force-push unless rebase).
7) Squash & Merge; delete branch; tag release if user-visible; update CHANGELOG automatically.
8) Report back with PR link, tag, and release notes summary.
```

---

### 15) Do / Don’t

* ✅ Do keep PRs < 400 lines of diff when possible; split otherwise.
* ✅ Do reference issues and SPEC sections; keep changes scoped.
* ❌ Don’t push to `main`.
* ❌ Don’t bypass CI or skip tests.
* ❌ Don’t commit secrets, large binaries, or environment-specific configs.
